Project Brief: 
===============================
*Open Design Workshop Series in NYC*

Our goal is to provide Global Kids staff and youth with an intuitive tool that empowers youth to “own” their skills data, allowing them to get recommendations for extended learning opportunities in their domains of interest and expertise across their community. In addition to sharing information, youth will want to explore the projects, skills and interests of their peers. This will allow youth to be exposed to different, free and like-minded organizations so that they can find the tools and mentorship to build upon the digital leadership skills that they already have.

**We’ll be designing concepts for the skills application that:**

- Will require users to input skills data
- Targets staff and students who primarily use desktop and mobile devices
- Takes privacy into consideration
- Will be used by a variety of user types (mentors, adminstrative staff, students, etc.)
- Shows the data in a meaningful and explanatory way

**Challenges:**

- Provide a flexible experience that can respond to shifting needs across user contexts 
- Position this tool as a potential learning opportunity for users
- Think about the mobile experience, and how needs shift across context, device and online "social" patterns
- Develop an appealing interface for youth - that speaks to them and not down at them.
