# Open Design Workshop Series

The Open Design workshop series provides an opportunity to use your design thinking skills on a real world open source social design project for a local nonprofit, working through an accelerated design process from start to finish, visit local institutions and learn concrete skills to bring back to your job. These workshops are open to the public to attend.
